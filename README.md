# PetProject
This is a project to play around with Git/GitHub + RStudio
Following steps have been conducted:

1- Create an empty project under RStudio
2- Create a new repo PetProject under GitHub

3- Link this new repo as remote for my local project - name must be origin so that RStudio is able to find it later:
   THIS MUST BE DONE using Git Bash - apparently not possible under RStudio????
  git remote add origin https://github.com/Aldohlys/PetProject.git

4- Modify my PetProject files, and finally commit under RStudio
5- Push under Rstudio or execute following under Git Bash:
  git push -u origin master
